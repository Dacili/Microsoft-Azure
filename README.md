# Microsoft-Azure

Expanding my knowledge in Microsoft Azure. 
Preparing for my Azure fundamentals exam (AZ-900).

Currently learning the most commonly used Microsoft Azure services, such as resource groups, subscriptions, API Management, db servers, databases, storages, key vaults, virtual machine, app service, web jobs, application insights, serverless functions, app configurations...

**API MANAGEMENT** - manage all your APIs, entry point for requests (from frontend) to backend
